                <p>Netflix</p>

                <p> Netflix uses Contrast to make important information stand out, 
                    such as new releases or popular titles. Applying the contrast through the use of larger 
                    images, text, bold colors, and a dark background, makes the content stands out, being
                    more atractive for the user. The image above displays how the contrast makes a huge difference
                    in showing the important elements of the webpage, the content seems to either be more visible or 'shine', the matter
                    is that the use of the contrast makes it stand out causing the content to be better noticed by the user.

                <h3>Space and Clean Design</h3>
                <p>Google</p>
                <a href="https://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>
                <img src="../lesson2/images/google.png" alt="">
                <p>Google's homepage is an excellent example of clean design and the effective use of space. The page is centered, 
                    with plenty of white space around the search box and buttons. The page looks clean by itself,
                    the font is simple and easy to read, and there are no distracting images or graphics. The content is 
                    focused to be easily viewed and understood by the end user, the most important principle of effect web-design
                    applied on this website is the cleaness and the soft spaces making the content visualy appealing,
                    simple and organized.</p>

                <h3>Alignment</h3>
                <p>Amazon</p>
                <a href="https://m.youtube.com">www.amazon.com</a>
                <img src="../lesson2/images/amazon.png" alt="amz">
                <p>Amazon uses alignment to create a clean and organized layout. 
                The website uses a consistent layout using spacing and alignment, 
                making it easy for users to scan and find what they're looking for. As the alignment design
                property is often visible because of how the elements are organized and creates
                a sense of unity by providing structure connecting elements in a subtle way,
                the amazon website clearly uses grid to organize its content, making them
                easier for the user to interact with.</thead></p>
